## Top 200 Stocks by Return Potential

### Primary Growth Catalysts

+ Biotech Breakthrough Potential: Companies like those in gene therapy, inflammation, and neuroscience are attracting significant investor attention with FDA approvals continuing at rapid pace.
+ Cannabis Regulatory Momentum: US cannabis rescheduling from Schedule I to Schedule III could remove banking barriers and boost sector sentiment.
+ AI Infrastructure Demand: The global AI market is expected to grow from $235 billion in 2024 to over $631 billion in 2028.
+ Small-Cap Recovery Potential: Small caps are trading at bargain basement prices with lower valuations signalling undiscovered value.

### Risk Considerations

+ Biotech stocks carry binary outcome risks from clinical trials
+ Cannabis stocks remain subject to federal regulatory uncertainty
+ Penny stocks exhibit high volatility and liquidity constraints
+ Many companies are pre-revenue or loss-making

### Strategic Approach

Focus on Tier 1-2 stocks for highest conviction plays, whilst using Tier 3-5 for diversification across multiple growth themes. Monitor upcoming catalysts including FDA approvals, earnings reports, and regulatory developments that could trigger significant price movements. The selection prioritises companies with near-term catalysts, strong technical setups, or exposure to high-growth sectors positioned for 2025 outperformance.
